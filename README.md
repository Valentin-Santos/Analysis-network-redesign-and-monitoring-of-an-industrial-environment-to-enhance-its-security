# Analysis, Network Redesign, and Monitoring of an Industrial Environment for Cybersecurity Improvement

## Description

This project focuses on improving the cybersecurity of a real industrial environment. The work covers several key tasks:

- **Overview of Industrial Cybersecurity:** Presents relevant concepts, regulations, and industrial communication protocols used throughout the project.  
- **Description of Industrial Control Devices:** Details the devices used and the selected monitoring solution.  
- **Initial Analysis and Security Enhancements:** The system is analyzed and security improvements are implemented in two phases:  
  1. **Phase 1:** Initial network segmentation and analysis of communications between devices.  
  2. **Phase 2:** Optimized network segmentation, traffic flow control between zones, and implementation of a DMZ network to protect the industrial network from external access.  

Additionally, the **Tenable OT Security** monitoring solution is deployed in a dedicated monitoring network, and various attacks are simulated to test the effectiveness of the system and ensure security events are correctly reported.

## Technologies and Tools Used

- Tenable OT Security  
- PLCs and industrial control devices  
- Network segmentation and DMZ  
- Industrial communication protocols  

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to **enhance the cybersecurity of an industrial environment** through analysis, network redesign, and monitoring, verifying the effectiveness of implemented measures via simulated attacks.
